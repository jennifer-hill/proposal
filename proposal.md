## City overview

> An overview of the host city: why is it suitable for useR!, how easy is it to get to?

### City Suitability

NYC occupies a central position within the Northeast Meagalopolis, containing over 50 million people. That gives a large local audience to attend the conference. The city has three universities, NYU, Columbia, and CUNY, between them having over 360 thousand students. Additionally, the city has an strong presence in data science-related industries, particularly finance and healthcare.

### Travelling to NYC

NYC has three airports close by, two of which are international: John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport. The city's position on the East coast allows for relatively easy attendance from Europe and Africa.

It is on a major Amtrak train route, and has many long-distance bus services, allowing for access from nearby cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington.


## Venue overview

> An overview of the proposed venue(s): what are the capacities of each room, how will it accommodate the planned events?



## Suggested dates

> Potential dates (when venue is free/avoiding major meetings)

The preferred date is for tutorials on 2020-07-07 (Tuesday), with the conference lasting from 2020-07-08 to 2020-07-10 (Wednesday to Friday).

The previous week is undesirable since it clashes with [The International Society for Bayesian Analysis World Meeting](https://bayesian.org/events/world-meetings), and many people may wish to attend both events.

## Accommodation

## Schedule and format

> Plans for the general format of the conference and the social program

We propose to follow the standard useR format.

- Tuesday consists of half day tutorials (at extra cost), and has a tourism-based social event in the evening.
- Talks run from Wednesday to Friday, including parallel sessions and at least six keynote talks. 
- Wednesday includes a session for sponsors. The evening event is a drinks, networking, and poster session.
- Thursday includes breakout sessions for special interest groups. The evening event is a dinner (ticket required).
- Friday includes lightning talks and an early finish.
